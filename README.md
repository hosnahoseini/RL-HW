# Reinforcement Learning Homework 

## Homework 1: SAC and Behavioral cloning
- implement the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm on the CartPole environment to maximize reward and entropy, encouraging exploration. We then use the learned policy to collect expert trajectories and perform behavioral cloning.

## Homework 2: Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Value-Based RL

   - Train a DQN agent on the [LunarLander-v2] task 
   - Apply value-based RL algorithms to the CliffWalking-v0 task.

## Homework 3: On-Policy RL Algorithms
   - Implement REINFORCE and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and evaluate and test the performance of these algorithms.
